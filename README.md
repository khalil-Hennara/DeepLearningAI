# Deep learning AI

this is the assignment of the deeplearning.ai from Coursera and all the dependence.
each course has an empty Notebook and solved notebook, I recommend tries to solve the empty notebook before seeing the solution.
this is an old version of the assignment and maybe the new version on the website has changed a little but the concept is the same.
you can check the full course hear: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

for all dataset I upload on drive and this is the link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RdXW_3aMygEHtl8BqtGiY5o-iO_HRlPt/view?usp=sharing
