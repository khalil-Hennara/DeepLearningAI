# Deep learning AI

this is the assignment of the deeplearning.ai from Coursera and all the dependence.
each course has an empty Notebook and solved notebook, I recommend tries to solve the empty notebook before seeing the solution.
this is an old version of the assignment and maybe the new version on the website has changed a little but the concept is the same.
